All Prisma Client queries return an instance of `PrismaPromise`. This is a ["thenable"](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/thenable), meaning a `PrismaPromise` only executes when you call `await` or `.then()` or `.catch()`. This behavior is different from a regular JavaScript [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), which starts executing immediately.

For example:

```ts
const findPostOperation = prisma.post.findMany({}) // Query not yet executed

findPostOperation.then() // Prisma Client now executes the query
// or
await findPostOperation // Prisma Client now executes the query
```

When using the [`$transaction` API](/concepts/components/prisma-client/transactions#the-transaction-api), this behavior makes it possible for Prisma Client to pass all the queries on to the query engine as a single transaction.
